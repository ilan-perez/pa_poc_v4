## AI is woven into the fiber of the Pyramid platform

Data scientists typically use standalone software tools to conduct advanced analysis. With Pyramid, they can apply machine learning techniques to their data using the same platform as other analysts and professionals within the organization. When everyone is working in a shared analytic environment, there’s more opportunity for collaboration—and insight—across the organization.
